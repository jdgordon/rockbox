tcctool for Windows
-------------------

Installation
------------

When you first attach your device in USB boot mode to your computer,
Windows should display the Found New Hardware Wizard.

If this doesn't appear, and if you have previously used a firmware
recovery tool with your device, you will need to uninstall the USB
driver used by that application.

Go into Control Panel -> System -> Hardware -> Device Manager, then
click on Universal Serial Bus Controllers, look for something like
"Telechips TCC77x VTC USB Driver", right-click on it and select
Uninstall.

After doing this, disconnect and reconnect your device and the Found
New Hardware Wizard should appear.

Select "No, not this time" to the question about connecting to Windows
Update, and select "Install from a list or specific location
(Advanced)" on the next screen.

On the next screen, select "Search for the best driver in these
locations", unselect "Search removable media", select "Include this
location in the search:" and browse to the tcctool-driver-win32
folder.

You should now be able to run tcctool.exe
